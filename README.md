# Hi, I'm <Akshat Upadhyay>! 👋

I’m a Software Engineer with 2 years of professional experience developing scalable, high-performance applications across cloud, web, and AI-driven ecosystems.

Skilled in Java, Spring Boot, React, TypeScript, and AWS, with hands-on exposure to microservices, containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), and modern AI frameworks like LangChain and OpenAI APIs. My experience spans designing backend architectures, deploying cloud-native solutions, and experimenting with intelligent systems that bridge software engineering and machine learning.


## 🚀 About Me

- 💻 Software Engineer currently working at Marsh McLennan, with hands-on experience in building scalable backend systems and secure integrations.
- ⚙️ Focused on backend engineering, distributed systems, security, and cloud architecture. I like understanding how things work end-to-end. Therefore, everything's imprinted in here 🧠.
- 🤖 Exploring GenAI + ML-driven systems and how they can transform real engineering workflows, automation, and product capabilities.
- ☁️ Comfortable across the stack, but I naturally gravitate towards system design, backend logic, APIs, and solving high-impact engineering problems.
- 📚 Constant learner — whether it’s improving my Japanese, exploring AI-driven developer workflows, or mastering AWS or possibly Azure, I love picking up skills that compound over time.
- 🧠 I believe in building systems that are clean, predictable, tested, and scalable — and in thinking slowly but executing fast.


## Work Experience 🧑‍💻
- Software Engineer @ Marsh McLennan - 🧩 Built and deployed Spring Boot APIs, added Kafka-based event processing, and created supporting UI flows in React for internal operational teams.
- Associate Engineer @ Z1 Tech - ☁️ Built Node.js backend services, used Redis for caching, deployed serverless workflows on AWS, and developed internal Vue.js tooling.
